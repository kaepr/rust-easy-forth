# Rust Easy Forth

An interpreter for a [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) dialect written in Rust.

I am following the examples in [Easy Forth by Nick Morgan](https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/) 
as the tests.

I am working on this project as a way to revise Rust, and learn more about Forth.

Work in progress ...

## Run

``` shell
cargo run
```

## Test

``` shell
cargo test
```

Found about [Easy Forth by Nick Morgan](https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/) from [Cobb Coding](https://www.youtube.com/@cobbcoding/featured) youtube channel. 
They have a series on building forth interpreters using Rust and Go.

This conference talk [Strange Loop | Concatenative programming and stack-based languages" by Douglas Creager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umSuLpjFUf8) is a nice introduction to stack based languages.
